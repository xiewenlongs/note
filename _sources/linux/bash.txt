history 在多终端下的表现
````````````````````````````

- There is the history in the history file.
- There is the history in the memory of a bash process.
- The history in the memory of one bash process is not synced with the history in the memory of any other bash process.
- The history in the memory of a bash process is not synced with the history in the file, unless explicitly asked to or during some specific event (see below).
- During startup bash will read the history file. The content of the history file is now in the memory of the bash process.
- During normal use only the history in memory is manipulated.
- During shutdown the history in memory is written to the history file, overwriting any previous content of the history file.


 可以在 ~/.bashrc 里，加入 ``shopt -s histappend``, 来防止多terminator 相互覆盖.bash_history，
 但是时间戳会乱


history 设置
``````````````````````````````
- HISTFILESIZE=2000
- HISTSIZE=2000
- HISTTIMEFORMAT="%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S: "   每个操作，加上时间戳
- export HISTTIMEFORMAT
- shopt -s histappend

判断程序输出是否重定向
